        p This page can be seen whether you are "logged in" or not
        p There is another page (Test PageB) which you cannot see, until you are "logged in"
        p See the files:
        ul
            li index.js
            li api.js
            li main.ejs
        p To see how this is done
        hr
        p The main file (main.ejs) ensures that you can load "partials" (generated by jade in this example), instead of reloading the whole page
        p The top menu will never be reloaded, the partials replaces the area marked with a blue background for this page when a "matching" menu item is pressed.
